# DSDE1-Computing1 Assessment 1 Instructions

This is an open book/computer/internet asssessment. You are allowed to refer to your own notes, previous code, and search online. You are NOT be allowed to receive or ask for assistance from any individual such as a fellow classmate or anyone else during the assessment. You may NOT share your code with anyone else until all students have completed the assessment and submission has closed.

If the code you write will be marked using a test file, that test file has been provided so that you can test your code yourself. Note that all code will be also evaluated with PyLint, so you are encouraged to use PyLint to evaluate your own code before the final submission.

## How to Complete the Assessment

1. Clone this repository on your own computer.

2. Commit your answers and push them to your repo on Github. You can (and are encouraged) to do this continuously as you work on the questions.

3. Ensure that you are correctly pushing your changes to the repo by checking on Github for your additions.

4. Your final answers must be pushed by **12pm** (the end of the assessment), unless you have been explicitly been allowed extended time as a reasonable adjustment as recommended by the Disability Advisory Services (students for which this applies have been contacted). Any pushed commits after this time will not be considered for marks.


## Using Git

1. Clone this repository on your computer (do not clone it within an existing repository such as the weekly exercises or the practice assessment). Edit the file `question1.txt` to include your name and CID.    *[5 points]*

## Flowcharts

2. Open `question2-flowchart.png` and write the corresponding Python code that implements the described algorithm in `question2.py`. Test that it runs correctly with the provided test file, `test_question2.py`.    *[10 points]*

## Reading and Understanding Errors

3. Open and try to run `question3.py`. Fix the problems in the code so that it runs without throwing any errors and passes the test file.    *[5 points]*

4. Open and try to run `question4.py`. Fix the problems in the code so that it runs without throwing any errors and passes the test file.    *[5 points]*

5. Open and try to run `question5.py`. Fix the problems in the code so that it runs without throwing any errors and passes the test file.    *[5 points]*


## Writing Python Functions

5. Open `question6.py` and follow the instructions in the comments to write the requested functions. Test that your code runs correctly with the provided test file, `test_question6.py`.    *[70 points, 10 points for each function]*

## Marking Rubric

Detailed marking rubrics can be seen directly in the Python files for each question.
