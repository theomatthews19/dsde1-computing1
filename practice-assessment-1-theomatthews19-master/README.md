# DSDE1-Computing1 Practice Assessment 1 Instructions

This is a chance to practice the open book/computer/internet asssessment. You are allowed to refer to your own notes, previous code, and search online. If this was the actual assessment, then you would NOT be allowed to receive or ask for assistance from any individual such as a fellow classmate or anyone else during the assessment. You may NOT share your code with anyone else until all students have completed the assessment and submission has closed.

If the code you write will be marked using a test file, that test file has been provided so that you can test your code yourself. Note that all code will be also evaluated with PyLint, so you are encouraged to use PyLint to evaluate your own code before the final submission.

## How to Complete the Practice Assessment

1. Clone this repository on your own computer.

2. Commit your answers and push them to your repo on Github. You can (and are encouraged) to do this continuously as you work on the questions.

3. Ensure that you are correctly pushing your changes to the repo by checking on Github for your additions.

4. Your final answers must be pushed by the **11pm on Tuesday, 29 October**. Any pushed commits after this time will not be considered for the anonymous marking exercise on Thursday.


## Flowcharts

1. Open `question1-flowchart.png` and write the corresponding Python code that implements the described algorithm in `question1.py`. Test that it runs correctly with the provided test file, `test_question1.py`.    *[10 points]*

2. Open `question2.py` and draw a flowchart that illustrates the algorithm implemented in the code. A test file is also provided in case you find it useful to help demonstrate the algorithm. To create the flowchart, you can either use digital tools or draw on paper and take a photo of your flowchart. Save and commit the flowchart as `question2-flowchart.png`.    *[10 points]*


## Reading and Understanding Errors

3. Open and try to run `question3.py`. Fix the problems in the code so that it runs without throwing any errors.    *[5 points]*

4. Open and try to run `question4.py`. Fix the problems in the code so that it runs without throwing any errors.    *[5 points]*


## Writing Python Functions

5. Open `question5.py` and follow the instructions in the comments to write the requested functions. Test that your code runs correctly with the provided test files, `test_question5.py`.    *[70 points, 10 points for each function]*
