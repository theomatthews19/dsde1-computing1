Simple functions performing operations on basic Python data structures.

# Lists

# Write a function that merges two lists together only if the length of both
# lists is greater than 4. Otherwise return an empty list.
def merge_list(list1, list2):
    return

# Write a function that returns a list containing unique values from the input_list.
# In other words, any repeated values are removed.
def unique_values(input_list):
    return

# Strings

# Write a function that returns a string where first "x" characters are lower
# case. "x" is passed as the second parameter. 
def start_to_lower(string, x):
    return

# Write a function that returns the character which first occurs for the second
# time in the string. For example in string "abcdefcab" the character "c"
# occurs twice first. If no character occurs more than once, an empty string
# should be returned. 
def first_double_char(string):
    return 

# Dictionaries

# Write function that returns a sum of all values stored in the dictionary.
def sum_of_dict(dictionary):
    return

# Write a function that returns a new dictionary where each value is multiplied
# by 3. Example: for input dictionary {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} the returned
# dictionary will be {'a': 3, 'b': 6, 'c': 9}
def multiply_dict(dictionary):
    return

# Arguments


# Write a function with the first argument mandatory and the second optional.
# The first argument accepts a list as an argument, the second accepts two
# strings "max" or "min". The function returns either the maximum or the
# minimum value from the list. The default operation is "max". If the operation
# is neither "max" nor "min" the function should return "None" (the value, not
# the string).
def max_min(input_list, operation):
    return
